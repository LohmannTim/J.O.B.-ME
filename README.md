Application Overview
(Provide a high-level description of what the application is/does. Consider this the summary or elevator pitch you would use to get someone interested in your project.)

My application guides the user from the beginning of a job search to the first day in their new job.  I will use a schema approach for each step of the process from getting organized, building a resume, finding employers, interviewing, compensation negotiation and much more.  Where this app is unique is that it a step by step approach that the individual can use to track their progress, get updates/reminders on how the search is coming, and make anyone feel confident in their search by breaking it down into the smallest pieces
Application Features
(ALL of the features of this application will be listed below with details as to how they will work. Write it from the user perspective but also note any business logic that dictates behavior.)
